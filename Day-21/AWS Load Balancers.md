**AWS Load Balancers:**

**Introduction**

In modern cloud-native architectures, ensuring high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance is critical. Load balancers play a central role in distributing traffic across multiple servers and improving application performance. AWS offers three types of managed load balancers: **Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB)**, and **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**. Each is designed to handle traffic at different layers of the OSI model and serves unique use cases.

In this article, you'll learn:

•	What a load balancer is and why it's essential.

•	The OSI model and how it relates to AWS Load Balancers.

•	Differences between ALB, NLB, and GWLB.

•	Real-world use cases and best practices.

**What Is a Load Balancer?**

A **load balancer** distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers (EC2 instances) to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This enhances **application availability, reliability**, and **performance**.

**Example Scenario:**

You deploy a game app on a single EC2 instance. Initially, five users access it—no issues. But as the app gains popularity, 100+ users try accessing it. One instance can't handle the load, resulting in **slowness** or **downtime**.

**Solution:**

Deploy your app on multiple EC2 instances and place a **load balancer** in front of them. The load balancer distributes incoming traffic to the healthy instances, providing a seamless experience to users.

**Why the OSI Model Matters**

To understand how AWS Load Balancers function, it's important to grasp the **OSI model**, which consists of seven layers describing how data flows from a client to a server:

| Layer | Name                | Function                                              |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 7     | Application         | Defines protocols like HTTP, FTP                      |
| 6     | Presentation        | Handles encryption (e.g., TLS)                        |
| 5     | Session             | Manages sessions between clients and servers         |
| 4     | Transport           | Splits data into packets, ensures secure transmission |
| 3     | Network             | Manages IP addressing and routing                     |
| 2     | Data Link           | Handles MAC addressing, switches                      |
| 1     | Physical            | Transmits data over physical cables                   |

**Key Insight:**

•	**ALB** operates at **Layer 7** (Application Layer).

•	**NLB** operates at **Layer 4** (Transport Layer).

•	**GWLB** is used for **virtual appliances** like firewalls and VPNs.

**AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

**What Is It?**

An ALB works at **Layer 7** and makes intelligent routing decisions based on HTTP/HTTPS requests.

**Features**

•	Host-based routing

•	Path-based routing

•	Header inspection

•	SSL termination

•	Weighted target groups (ratio-based routing)

**Real-World Use Case:**

E-commerce site like amazon.com with microservices:

•	/login → routed to Login Service

•	/payments → routed to Payment Service

•	/orders → routed to Orders Service

```sh
# Example ALB Listener Rule
Conditions:
  Path: /login
Actions:
  TargetGroup: login-service-target-group
```

**When to Use ALB:**

•	Applications using HTTP/HTTPS protocols

•	Need for intelligent routing (based on paths/headers/host)

•	Want to offload SSL/TLS from backend services

**Pros:**

•	Advanced routing features

•	Ideal for microservices and web applications

**Cons:**

•	Slightly higher latency due to HTTP inspection

•	More expensive compared to NLB

**AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

**What Is It?**

An NLB operates at **Layer 4** and routes traffic based on **TCP/UDP protocols**, providing ultra-low latency.

**Features:**

•	Supports static IPs

•	Handles millions of requests per second

•	Preserves the source IP

•	Supports TLS termination

**Real-World Use Case:**

Live video streaming on platforms like **YouTube** or **Twitch**:

•	Requires low-latency, high-throughput data transmission

•	Any delay impacts user experience

**When to Use NLB:**

•	High-performance TCP/UDP traffic

•	Game servers or streaming platforms

•	Where speed and connection consistency are vital

**Sticky Sessions:**

NLB supports **sticky sessions** which ensure that all packets from the same client go to the same backend server.

**Pros:**

•	Extremely fast and efficient

•	Lower cost than ALB

•	Supports TLS and preserves client IP

**Cons:**

•	No advanced routing (like path or host-based routing)

**AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**

**What Is It?**

GWLB works with **virtual appliances** and operates at **Layer 3 and 4**, enabling seamless deployment of services like **firewalls, intrusion detection systems**, and **VPNs**.

**Features:**

•	Transparent insertion of virtual appliances

•	High availability and scalability

•	Deep packet inspection

**Real-World Use Case:**

You're working with a **firewall** or **VPN solution** from vendors like Palo Alto or Fortinet. These appliances require deep packet inspection and cannot be efficiently handled by ALB or NLB.

**When to Use GWLB:**

•	Deploying security appliances

•	VPN solutions

•	Deep packet inspection use cases

**Pros:**

•	Designed for secure, third-party traffic inspection

•	Scalable and elastic with AWS auto-scaling

**Cons:**

•	Specific to niche use cases

•	Not suitable for typical web or API traffic
