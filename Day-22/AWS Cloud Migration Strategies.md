**Cloud Migration Strategies on AWS:**

**Introduction**

As organizations accelerate their journey to the cloud, understanding **cloud migration strategies** becomes a key skill for DevOps and Cloud engineers. From global banks to modern startups, businesses are either planning, starting, or in the middle of migrating their applications to public cloud platforms like **AWS, Azure**, or **Google Cloud.**

In this article, we’ll break down AWS cloud migration strategies not just theoretically, but with **real-world project insights** that go beyond textbook definitions. Whether you're interviewing for a DevOps role or handling a live migration project, this guide will give you a comprehensive understanding of how **cloud migration really works**—from start to finish.

**Why Cloud Migration Strategies Matter**

While there are plenty of blogs and videos explaining the **7 Cloud Migration Strategies**, interviews and real-world scenarios demand **practical knowledge**. Recruiters are not just looking for people who can list "lift and shift"; they want to hear about **project planning, team coordination, tooling, monitoring, and optimization**.

**The Five Phases of Cloud Migration**

Every successful cloud migration project follows these **five core stages**:

**1. Preparation**

•	**Assess current architecture** (monolith vs microservices)

•	Identify critical vs non-critical applications

•	Plan for transformation if migrating from monolithic to microservices

•	Consider containerization for better scalability and deployment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)

**2. Planning**

•	**Define migration phases**: Break down large application sets (e.g., 200 microservices) into multiple manageable phases

•	**Determine migration strategy per phase** (see "7 R’s" below)

•	Decide which applications go first based on risk, complexity, and criticality

**3. Migration**

•	Execute migration using appropriate strategy

•	Implement DevOps automation (e.g., Terraform scripts, Jenkins pipelines, AWS CLI)

•	Migrate applications and infrastructure resources in phases

**4. Monitoring**

•	Post-migration validation (e.g., dashboards, alerts, performance monitoring)

•	Use tools like **CloudWatch, Datadog**, or **Prometheus**

•	Gather feedback from internal users or beta customers

**5. Optimization**

•	Analyze cost savings, scalability, performance improvements

•	Evaluate if AWS services (like Auto Scaling, S3 lifecycle rules, Graviton instances) can further reduce costs or enhance performance

•	Set goals for improving efficiency in the next optimization cycle

**The 7 Cloud Migration Strategies (The “7 R’s”)**

AWS outlines seven key migration strategies. While you don’t need to use all of them, understanding each is critical:

**1. Rehost ("Lift and Shift")**

•	Move applications from on-prem to AWS with minimal changes

•	Example: Migrate Kubernetes clusters as-is to EC2-backed clusters on AWS

•	**Best for**: Quick wins, legacy systems with minimal OS/hardware dependency

**2. Replatform ("Lift, Tinker, and Shift")**

•	Make small optimizations without changing the app’s core architecture

•	Example: Move database to Amazon RDS, improve availability using multi-region deployments

•	**Best for**: Teams wanting to take advantage of AWS capabilities without a full redesign

**3. Refactor / Re-architect**

•	Rewrite and optimize applications for the cloud

•	Example: Transform monolithic apps into microservices using AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS

•	**Best for**: Applications requiring scalability, agility, and modern design

**4. Repurchase**

•	Replace an existing on-prem software license with a SaaS solution

•	Example: Move from on-prem CRM to Salesforce or Dynamics 365

•	**Best for**: Commercial software that’s better delivered via SaaS

**5. Retire**

•	Identify obsolete applications and decommission them

•	**Best for**: Unused, redundant, or low-value applications

**6. Retain**

•	Keep certain applications on-premises due to regulatory, latency, or other constraints

•	**Best for**: Secure, highly sensitive apps (e.g., mainframe banking applications)

**7. Relocate**

•	Move infrastructure to AWS without purchasing new hardware or refactoring

•	Example: VMware Cloud on AWS, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA)

•	**Best for**: Large-scale lift and shift without changing tools/platforms

**Real-World Migration Example: Monolith to Microservices on AWS**

Let’s say your company has:

•	**200 microservices** OR **a monolithic application**

•	The goal is to move to AWS using **microservices on EKS**

**Phase 1** (Preparation):

•	Assess current architecture

•	Break monolith into microservices

•	Containerize applications using Docker

**Phase 2** (Planning):

•	Group microservices into migration phases (Phase 1–5)

•	Assign priorities based on criticality

•	Choose strategies: e.g., Rehost low-risk apps first, Refactor the core

**Phase 3** (Migration):

•	Use Terraform to provision EC2 and EKS clusters

•	Deploy services with Helm, ArgoCD, or Jenkins CI/CD

•	Test via automation scripts and manual validation

**Phase 4** (Monitoring):

•	Set up CloudWatch alarms

•	Analyze performance pre- and post-migration

•	Run feedback loops with internal stakeholders

**Phase 5** (Optimization):

•	Review cost reports from AWS Cost Explorer

•	Apply cost-saving recommendations (e.g., reserved instances, auto-scaling)

•	Plan re-architecture of Phase 1 apps if needed

**Special Consideration: Database Migrations**

Databases require additional care:

•	Use managed services like **Amazon RDS, Aurora**, or **DynamoDB**

•	Always perform **data backups** before migration

•	Run shadow environments (staging) for rollback readiness

•	Plan for DNS redirection or application-level fallback in case of failure
________________________________________
**Best Practices for DevOps Engineers in Cloud Migrations**

•	Use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform, CloudFormation

•	Automate CI/CD pipelines for each migration phase

•	Containerize applications where possible (Docker, Podman)

•	Set up robust monitoring and alerting early

•	Maintain rollback and recovery strategies

•	Document each phase clearly for audits and cross-team communication

**Conclusion**

Migrating to the cloud is more than just "lift and shift." It requires deep **planning, engineering collaboration, phased execution**, and **continuous optimization**. By mastering these migration stages and understanding the “7 R’s” in a real-world context, DevOps engineers can lead cloud transformation efforts with confidence.

**Don't just talk about migration strategies—talk about your role in each stage. That's what impresses interviewers and hiring managers.**
