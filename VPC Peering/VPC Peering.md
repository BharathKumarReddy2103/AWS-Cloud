**What is VPC Peering?**

VPC Peering is a **networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)** that allows them to communicate with each other **privately** as if they were in the same network. This connection is established using **private IP addresses** and does not require a VPN, internet gateway, or AWS Direct Connect.

**How VPC Peering Works**

•	VPC Peering is **non-transitive**, meaning if **VPC A is peered with VPC B, and VPC B is peered with VPC C**, traffic from 
  VPC A cannot reach VPC C unless there is a direct peering connection.

•	It is **low-latency and high-bandwidth** since the traffic stays within AWS’s private network.

•	Each VPC involved must **manually configure routing tables** to allow communication.

**Key Components of VPC Peering**

1.	**Requester VPC** – The VPC that initiates the peering request.

2.	**Accepter VPC** – The VPC that accepts the peering request.
  
3.	**Routing Tables** – Must be updated in both VPCs to allow traffic flow.
   
4.	**Security Groups & NACLs** – Should be adjusted to permit communication between VPCs.

**VPC Peering Deep Dive**

1.	**Network Design Considerations**

      o	VPC Peering can be used within the same AWS region or across different AWS regions (Inter-Region VPC Peering).

      o	Overlapping CIDR blocks are not allowed – The two VPCs must have different IP address ranges.

2.	**Transitive Peering Limitation**

       o	VPC Peering does not support **transitive routing**. If multiple VPCs need to communicate, you must create a
          direct peering connection between each pair.

4.	**Billing & Cost Consideration**
   
      o	Data transfer **within the same region** via VPC Peering is cheaper than sending data over the internet.

      o	Inter-region data transfer has **higher costs**, similar to AWS Direct Connect or AWS Transit Gateway.

5.	**Security & Access Control**

      o	Security Groups and Network ACLs must allow inbound and outbound traffic.

      o	AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) can be used to restrict who can create or accept peering connections.

**Real-World Use Case: Multi-Account Architecture in AWS**

**Scenario: Connecting Dev, Staging, and Production VPCs**

A company has three environments:
•	**Development VPC** (dev-vpc)

•	**Staging VPC** (staging-vpc)

•	**Production VPC** (prod-vpc)

Each environment is deployed in separate AWS accounts, following best practices for **account isolation**.

**Problem:**

The **staging and production environments need access to a shared database in the production VPC**, but the company does not want to expose the database to the public internet.

**Solution:**

•	Establish **VPC Peering between staging-vpc and prod-vpc.**

•	Configure **routing tables** so that staging can communicate with the production database privately.

•	Ensure **security groups allow only specific IP ranges** from staging to access the database.

•	This setup **improves security and reduces costs** compared to using a VPN or internet-based communication.

**Alternatives to VPC Peering**

•	**AWS Transit Gateway** – If you need to connect **multiple VPCs in a hub-and-spoke model**, AWS Transit Gateway is a better solution because it supports transitive routing.

•	**AWS PrivateLink** – If you only need **one-way access** to services (e.g., accessing a shared database), PrivateLink is more secure and scalable.
